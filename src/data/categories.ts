We confirm you're the resident first, then choose the least-invasive method for your exact hardware: a 1920s mortise set is handled very differently from a modern Schlage or a Kwikset SmartKey cylinder. Drilling is a true last resort, used only on a failed or hardened lock once every other option is exhausted, and we tell you before we ever reach for a drill.
